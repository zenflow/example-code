> Command Line Interface for `example-code-compile`

```bash
$ npx example-code-cli --help
Usage: npx example-code-cli <input> [options]

Parameters:
  <input>      Html file to process

Options:
  --output     File to output to, defaults to <input>
  --help       Print help and exit
```

As you can see, the API is largely incomplete (only processes one file at a time). PRs welcome.
